# Ratiometric Imaging plugin for uManager

This is Java application, designed for CCD/CMOS camera-based fluorescence measurements.

## Features

* Automated experimental flow. Describe experimental stages once. Then, put your sample, press Start and wait.
* Automatic management of experimental data/labnotes storage. All naming, saving, comment templating is done automatically.
* Designed with ratiometric imaging tasks in mind.
* Online and offline analysis of fluorescence in ROIs with automatic background correction.
* Works on Windows, expected (but not tested) to work on MacOS.

##Requirements
	
* Works within uManager 2.0 framework (https://micro-manager.org/) as a plugin (based on API 2.0)
* Requires either LPT port or other digital state device (e.g. NI card with digital outs) to control Sutter filter wheel.
